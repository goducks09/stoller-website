This project was my second time being hired as a contractor. As the Lead Developer, I was responsible for translating the design team's mockups into a responsive, accessible Wordpress site using HTML/CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. Having never used Wordpress previously, this project was challenging. To prepare myself, I took a course on Udemy and read through the Wordpress documentation.

The project goal was to have a custom site with the ability for a non-technical user to easily make updates to the site layout and content. Due to the specificity in the design guides and the need for the site to persist in the future with minimal technical support, existing plugins had to be kept to a minimum. In researching, I found the best solution to be a custom theme and a plugin to create custom Gutenberg blocks.

A few of the notable features that I implemented were:
• custom color palette and font sizes that could be utilized in both custom and delivered block types
• infinite scrolling of posts
• fully responsive design for all screen sizes

In addition to being responsible for the development, I was in charge of making sure the hosting was set up properly.
